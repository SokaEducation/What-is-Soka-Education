                        <h3>The Tale of Three Founders</h3>
                        <p> Makiguchi devoted his life to developing a humanistic education system that would foster children’s creative potential and establish a foundation for life-long development.  While the outbreak of World War II prevented Makiguchi from seeing his ideas to fruition, his successors, Josei Toda (1900-1958) and Daisaku Ikeda (1928-_) have succeeded in fulfilling Makiguchi’s dream of flourishing an educational system that has the happiness of children as its core objective. </p> 
                        <p> In 1928, Makiguchi encountered and embraced Nichiren Buddhism, finding strong correlations between Buddhism and his educational beliefs. Toda also decided to embrace Buddhism. </p>
                        <p> In 1930, in a discussion with Makiguchi, Toda suggested the name "Value-Creating (Soka) Pedagogy" for the educational theory Makiguchi  had been developing throughout his career. Accepting Toda’s suggestion, Makiguchi published The System of Value Creating Pedagogy.That same year, Toda joined Makiguchi in founding the Soka Kyoiku Gakkai (Value-Creating Education Society), which  aimed at reforming society through education based on the Buddhist principles of peace, human rights and sanctity of life. </p> <a href="#"> Tale </a>

                        <h3>Josei Toda</h3>
                        <h4>(1900-1958)</h4>
                        <p> Josei Toda was born on February 11, 1900, to a family operating a fishing and shipping concession in Ishikawa Prefecture, Japan.  At the age of two, his family moved to Hokkaido, where he graduated from Atsuta Higher Elementary School with the highest grades in 1914.  At the age of 17, he obtained a teaching license for elementary education and started his teaching career in Yubari, Hokkaido. </p> 
                        <p>At the beginning of 1920, during a visit to Tokyo, Toda’s friend introduced him to Makiguchi.  The two educators discussed Japan's future and Makiguchi’s educational theory (value-creating pedagogy).  Toda was impressed by Makiguchi’s ideas, which were in stark contrast to the educational practices aimed at producing obedient subjects of the state rampant in Japan at the time.  </p> 
                        <p>Shortly afterwards, with Makiguchi’s help, Toda moved to Tokyo and began to work at Nishimachi Elementary School, headed by Makiguchi as the principal.  For the next 23 years, Toda worked for Makiguchi, supporting him in developing his educational theories.  He regarded Makiguchi as his mentor, even when they were both imprisoned as thought criminals for their opposition to World War II and their defense of religious freedom. </p>

                        <h3>Thought Criminals</h3>
                        <p> In the midst of the heightening tensions of World War II, the Japanese militaristic government enforced Shintoism as the state religion.  However, Makiguchi refused to surrender his religious beliefs and courageously stood up against the Japanese militaristic authorities. </p> 
                        <p> As a result, in July 1943, Makiguchi and Toda were arrested as thought criminals.  Makiguchi eventually passed away in jail on November 18th, 1944, at the age of 73. </p> 
                        <blockquote>
                            In the future, we must found a school based on the value-creating (Soka) pedagogy that I have been formulating. If we can’t do it during my lifetime, please do it in yours.

                        <p> For Toda, the death of his mentor in the hands of the militarist authorities was outrageous, which he could neither forgive nor forget.  In July 1945, Toda was released from prison and resolved to carry on Makiguchi’s philosophy.  </p> 
                        <p>Toda’s dream was to eliminate misery from all humankind.  He renamed the Soka Kyoiku Gakkai (Value-Creating Education Society), the small group of educators Makiguchi founded in 1930, as Soka Gakkai (Value-Creation Society).  </p> 
                        <p> He extended its membership from only educators to all people. In turn, he raised an enthusiastic successor who would carry on the dreams of both Toda and Makiguchi. </p> <a href="#">Resolve</a>

                        <p>After the war in 1947, at the age of 19, Ikeda met Toda who was giving a lecture at a *Soka Gakkai discussion meeting. Though having lost a brother in the war and he himself suffering from a severe case of tuberculosis, Ikeda displayed immense fervor in searching for the meaning of life.  Deeply moved by Toda’s sincerity and his wartime imprisonment experience, Ikeda decided to become Toda’s direct protégé and joined the Soka Gakkai.</p> <a href="#">Encounter</a>

                        <p> In 1949, Ikeda started working for Toda’s publishing company.  Ikeda wholeheartedly worked as an editor for a boys’ magazine, which had been his dream since his youth.  However, due to the post-war economic depression, Toda’s company experienced many financial difficulties. </p> <a href="#">Support</a>

                        <p>  In 1958, Toda’s health became exceedingly fragile.  As Toda sensed his impending death, with absolute trust, he passed to Ikeda his dream to build Soka schools and to achieve global peace.</p>

                        <p> In April of that year, Toda passed away.  Reflecting on his mentor’s passing, Ikeda wrote in his diary:</p> 
                        <blockquote> 
                            Today, I bid my final farewell to my mentor.  Want to visit his home alone, as I see fit.  No disciple is as grief-stricken and sad to part from [Mr. Toda] as I am. A strict father; a kind father.  Owe everything I am today to my beloved mentor.  Revere him.
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>Firmly determined to fulfill his mentor’s dream, Ikeda embarked on a new phase of his life—a life dedicated to global peace, culture and education. </p>
                        <blockquote>
                            Whatever hardship may be  imposed on me… I will dedicate my life to carrying out my mentor’s instructions.

# CFG: What is Soka Education

This project came out of a job hiring project from [Good.is](http://www.good.is). The project required users to complete a 16 lesson coding lesson and produce a final project. The initial final project I hoped to produce was overly complicated ([tripoutapp.com](www.tripoutapp.com)). Instead, I created a web page of an existing exhibition that is only viewable in person. The website will hopefully be viewed in the future to come to communicate the history and current state of Soka Education.
